Microsoft + Fater AI

**We joined Microsoft’s GenAI Studio at STATION F**

We're happy to share that we've joined Microsoft's hashtag#GenAIStudio, one of Europe's top accelerators happening right at STATION F, the world’s largest startup campus. Because yes, “spoken design” is the future—and we’re the ones making it happen.
With Fater AI and Microsoft powering this movement, consider your endless all-nighters officially canceled. You’re welcome.

We pitched to a panel of tech leaders, investors, and fellow startups—and let’s just say we found ourselves in great company.

Big thanks to the jury from NVIDIA, Mistral AI, GitHub, Danone, and Cellenza for the nod of approval.
