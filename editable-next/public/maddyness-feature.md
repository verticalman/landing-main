Maddyness — Fater AI at Microsoft GenAI Studio

**Building the spoken design stack**

Speech is the most natural interface designers use with each other. We’re turning that into production software. With Fater AI, creative intent becomes an API that agents can run—turning hours of manual work into minutes of guided exploration.

At Microsoft’s GenAI Studio, we presented how agentic programs learn a team’s design process and reproduce it with traceability: from brief to options to delivery. The result is faster iterations, repeatability, and higher quality at scale.

**Why this matters now**

- Tool chains are fragmented; teams lose time moving files and settings between apps.
- “One‑shot” generators don’t capture craft; process does. We encode that process.
- Enterprises need control: guardrails, auditability, and private model routing—all built in.

**What’s next**

We’re partnering with leading organizations to automate high‑leverage workflows in architecture, brand, and product design. If you want to pilot with us, reach out.
